		<h1>Pro-Surveillance Viewpoint</h1>
		<h2>Government Surveillance</h2>
			<p>Necessary in most countries</p>
			<p>Government control of surveillance equipment and products</p>
			<p>Complete surveillance of everything is currently not possible</p>
		<h2>What does the government really need to know?</h2>
			<p>Surveillance of every conversation and interaction</p>
			<p>Bits and Pieces, but which bits and pieces?</p>
		<h2>Citizens practicing risky personal data behaviors</h2>
		<h3>PCIF vs. PCIA</h3>
			<p>PCIF: Privacy concerns related to information finding</p>
			<p>PCIA: Privacy concerns related to information abuse</p>
		<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
			<p>Terrorist Organizations are against this type of security and surveillance.</p>
			<p>Citizens in both the United States and around the globe are wary of this option because they feel thier privacy could be taken away.</p>
			<p>The United States Government would benefit from this type of surveillance and want to be able to prevent terror using this type of surveillance program.</p>
			<p>Technology development companies could benefit from this system but are still wary because of the limited customer base and lack of growth potential with only the government as a customer.</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				Most of the time the government's motivation for collecting personal 
				surveillance information on individual citizens is minimal. The general argument
				for this scenario is, "If you aren't doing anything wrong or illegal, you should have
				nothing to be concerned about"
