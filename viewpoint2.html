		<h2>When can a Search be Performed?</h2>
		<p>With a warrant provided to a law-enforcement officer by the courts.</p>
		<p>When a reasonable amount of probable cause exists, e.g. contraband in 'plain-sight'</p>
		
		<h2>What Constitutes a 'Search'?</h2>
		<p>Courts state a 'reasonable expectation of privacy' must be present for a 'search' to have occurred.</p>
		<p>Open-Field Doctrine</p>
		
		<h2>Encrypted vs. Unencrypted Data</h2>
		<p>Two basic types of data being sent over the Internet</p>
		<p>Encrypted data cannot be easily read when intercepted</p>
		
		<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
			<p>The United States government might be against this type of policy.</p>
			<p>The general public will also likely be split on this issue, but would prefer it over full surveillance.</p>
			<p>Surveillance development companies will lose some business, and therefore would likely be against this.</p>
			<p>Terrorists may be able to take advantage by increasing their use of encryption.</p>
			
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Encrypted data should be protected and require a warrant to search. Unecrypted data does not provide an expectation of privacy, and therefore should not require a warrant to search.
