		<h2>Ethical Dilemma</h2>
		<p>Should the United States Government be allowed to use surveillance technology? And if so to what extent?</p>
		<h2>Research Methodologies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Google Search</li>
			<li>The Homeland Security Library</li>
			<li>Cornell Law Website</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Most of our resources were found online because widespread surveillance is a fairly recent issue.</p>
		<h2>Stakeholders Involved</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>United States Government</b> - wants to govern and protect its citizens and the nation as a whole. Willing to stop acts of terror even at a high cost.</li>
			<li><b>People in the United States</b> - U.S. Citizens want to be protected from terrorist threats, however they also want their right to privacy respected.</li>
			<li><b>People Outside of the United States</b> - Even people outside of the United States have been spyed on by the U.S. Government, so they will have similar concerns as people in the country.</li>
			<li><b>Surveillance Technology Development Companies</b> - Companies who develop surveillance technology will depend on governments being able to use their technology. They will push for surveillance.</li>
			<li><b>Terrorist Organizations</b> - Terror groups will find that committing acts of terror may become easier or more difficult depending on how far the government is willing and able to go to stop them.</li>
