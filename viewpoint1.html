		<h1>Anti-Surveillance Viewpoint</h1>
		<h2>Power Corrupts</h2>
			<p>Unlimited power leads to corruption</p>
			<p>NSA(National Security Administration) has already been caught abusing their power multiple times</p>
			<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/angela-merkel-denied-access-nsa-file">NSA Caught Spying on German Chancellor</a>
		<h2>Advantages</h2>
			<p>Prevent abuse of power</p>
			<p>More privacy - less risk for identity theft<p>
			<p>Less likely to cause tension between nations</p>
		<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
			<p>Harder to prevent terrorism</p>
			<p>Cant use surveillance tools to catch criminals</p>
		<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
			<p>The United States government can't monitor all of its citizens and look into foreign threats</p>
			<p>Citizens want to have their own privacy and not have all their conversations monitored and less likely to have their identity stolen</p>
			<p>The rest of the world will want this because they will not be spied on and this will force mutual trust between nations</p>
			<p>Surveillance development companies will lose a lot of business</p>
			<p>Terrorists will have greater freedom to commit atrocities but alternative methods can be taken to prevent this</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				The constant abuse of power by the government attests
				that the tools cant be trusted by them and that having more 
				law enforcement should be enough to counteract
				the negatives of not having these tools.
